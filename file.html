<p>My dearest Autwizz,</p>
<p>From the moment I first laid eyes on you, I thought tht you were gay (and cute). I am so lucky that you are not gay, because how else would I date you? It would not be possible if you were gay. Ok! I love the way that you cut your hair and that you keep changinfg it (youi should try platinum again). Not because it nessecarily looks cool (but I promise you that it does), but  because I think that it is indicative of your baller-ass spirit and attitude, and for that I love you like crazy.</p>

<p>I think that I told you this before but I love the way that you are unapollogetically true to yourself. You are hard on yourself, and sometimes you hold yourlself to societies metrics. Why? fuck that. You are cooler than they can appreciate, but me, I know art when I see it. You are truly the most amazing person I know (not an exageration just a fact (hence the reason I date you)).</p>

<div class="section">
<h2>The Reasons Why I Love You</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You are cool and funny</li>
  <li>I like the way you hate becayise it is cute</li>
  <li>You are the only person I can be myself around</li>

<h2>Our Love Story</h2>
<p>"Those look like lobsert shoes" (paraphase). That is what a comedic genius would have said if they saw me at air force last year. Unfortuanately I was too unwise to get the joke. But I am wiser now and i regret that I did not understand because then maybe I could have dated you a year earlier. Well I am lucky that you fouund me anyways. I likeyour butt.</p>
