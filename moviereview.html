                    This was a banger, but not as banger as I thought that it would be. I  was really nervous when we started watching because you were holding my hand in front of the whole team and that was the first time we had really been public in front of other peoople. I know it was not a huge deal, but it was important to me.

                    I didn't want to tell you why I wanted to watch this movie. I also forgot how much I like it. I think that I like it because it is a bit weird and quirky and difficult to follow.  I really enjoyed watching this one with you, even though I fell asleep both times.

                    Wow, thank you for reminding me how hard thsi movie was. I really like the cinematography. Like the scenes were really cool. Admittedly, I wsas falling asleep by the end, but I really enhjoyed the move. I can understand why it is your favorite. What I still cannot understand is why I am Rango though. OHHH, and my favorite part of the movie: sometimes you would like queue attention to a particular scene or try to quiet me or something and then you would watch it and burst out laughting. I love it when you do that. It was really cute.

                    I found a version online with English subtitles, but I think that it is in Turkish? Can't wait to be able to grab a clean version.

                    I watched like half of this with other Alex over summer between my freshman and sophmore year. It is really good and funny. I think that it is particullarly relevant to early adult int New York City. I think that it should be a lit-hum requirement.

                    If you couldn't tell from this and Mr. Fox, I like Wes Anderson films. I like the symmetry lol. I remember it being kinda weird quirky funny, but want to see it again. I also remember that there is a girl  with a tattoo of Mexico on her FACE?!?!?! Wack.
