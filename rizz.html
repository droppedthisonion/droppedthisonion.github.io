      var message = "Hello Alex, I noticed you have a profile picture of a very beautiful (but also intelligent looking!) female, and I am under the presumption that this godess is you? It is quite astonishing to see a female here in the autistic-fencers Official discord. I am quite popular around here in this server, so if you require guidance, please throw me a mention. I will assist you at any hour, day or night. And, before you are mistaken, I do not seek your hand in a romantic way; although I am not opposed in the event you are interested in me, as many women often are. I am a man of standard, and I do not bow to just any female that comes my way, unlike my peers... So rest assured that I will not be in the way of your gaming and socializing experience. Consider me a Player 2.. a twizzy a gang-member, and perhaps we can enjoy some video games together some time. I see you play val, and are you good at overwatch? I am an overwatch aficionado, so I would be happy to assist you in games. Platonically of course, unless you (like many others) change your mind on that. I look forward to our future together (as friends of course.)";
